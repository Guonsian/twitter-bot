# twitter-bot
This is a twitter bot, based in Python, using the Tweepy Library

It takes as an input a whatsapp conversation (in txt format), and then tweets random messages of the conversation, that messages will be saved in a json file afterwards to avoid having duplicate twitter status

It also supports photos, and the ability of copy the tweet of other person by sending the url to the bot via DM (you have to adjust that with the config.ini file and writing your id)
